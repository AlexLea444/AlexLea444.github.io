# Snake Game

by Alex Lea
May 14, 2024

This is a recreation of the classic game "Snake". It is being updated to
be played primarily on mobile, and is being moved toward the format of a
daily game, where the final state of the game can be shared.

The purpose of this project was to gain experience with HTML/CSS/JS, and
to apply OOP knowledge primarily gained in C++ and Rust to JavaScript.
